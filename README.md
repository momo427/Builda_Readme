# Builda Readme
  
  ## Desription 
   Using node and javascript I have created a application that takes in a users responses to a prompt and renders the information into a readme format.
   Purpose: You can quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project.
